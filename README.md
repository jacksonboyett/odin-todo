Create a tracker that Sam can use to add land plots that will keep track of
different properties of each plot of land such as name, location, price, area, 
notes section, and whether or not it has been sold.

Maybe add a revenue tracker.

Add area tabs that will keep track of each area: coconuts beach, jungle beach,
etc. 

View all land areas
View all land plots in each area
Expand a land plot to see the properties
Delete a plot

ADD A STORAGE API


Home page will have all the plots
Have a database of all plots that each module will read from 
For example, if plot has 'jungle' class, then the jungleTab module will populate it
Add plot will populate the database tab with all plots, and each tab will only grab
	the plots related to them

OR

Add a create plot module that every tab a plot is created it will publish to the homeTab and the tab that its classed in


// Create master object of plots
// Submit button will publish value into master plot object
